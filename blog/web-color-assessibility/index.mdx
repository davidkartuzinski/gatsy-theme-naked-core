**Web Color Accessibility** includes the concept of being, "[Perceivable](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html)". Part of this, is there must be sufficient color contrast and size between elements. Follow along and see the steps I took to bring this theme within the _WCAG Guidelines_.

Imagine, as website developers, that we receive a color palette. A designer hands us a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) file. Our job is to implement that design and color scheme into a component, or web page. Imagine a worse situation, you must come up with a design yourself? This can be a daunting task.

Whether you're implementing a design or creating a design, this is the moment that you must consider web accessibility. It is at this stage, [browser tools for checking accessibility like Axe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-web-accessibility-tes/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd), check for issues and then indicate how you should correct violations of the WCAG.

This blog post is for everyone who isn't [Jony Ive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive), [Erik Kennedy](http://erikdkennedy.com/) or a professional designer. (These people know this stuff, so this is for everyone else.)

These are the simple steps I take to create a color scheme and design from scratch. These steps can apply to designs that you are implementing. (Note: I am not a professional designer. Some people may huff and puff about how I explain things below. Feel free to follow their undoubtedly superior advise.) During this process, as applied to the **Gatsby Theme Naked Core**, I implement web accessibility recommendations.

## Start with content and fonts / typography

I find it easier to assign colors working from actual content on a page. This includes choosing fonts, font sizes, rhythm, etc. before adding color. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) makes this easier with a [typography plugin](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js) and a selection of typography themes. I am using [a typography theme called Funston](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js/tree/master/packages/typography-theme-funston).

This plugin and a theme do a lot of the work. (I did modify the theme a bit in the `src/utils/typography.js` file.)

## How to create a web color accessible palette?

I create a color scheme by choosing an accent color. I try to find a color that matches the desired mood of my website. (You can see different colors and their meaning and psychology on this website: [color meaning and psychology](https://graf1x.com/color-psychology-emotion-meaning-poster/).)
